# Depth-adaptive Deep Learning Model for Reconstructing 0–2000 m T-S Fields from Satellite Remote Sensing

This repository contains the code, experiments, and results for the paper "**Depth-adaptive deep learning model for reconstructing 0–2000 m T-S fields from satellite remote sensing**". The study focuses on the development and application of the **S-TSRM** model, which utilizes deep learning techniques to reconstruct temperature-salinity (T-S) fields from satellite remote sensing data.

## Overview

The **S-TSRM** (Stratified Temperature-Salinity Reconstruction Model) is a deep learning model designed to predict the temperature and salinity fields of the ocean from satellite remote sensing data, covering depths ranging from 0 to 2000 meters. The model leverages depth-adaptive mechanisms to accurately capture the dynamic characteristics of the ocean environment.

### Key Features:
- **Depth-adaptive**: The model is designed to handle varying ocean depths, providing more accurate T-S field reconstructions for different layers of the ocean.
- **Satellite Remote Sensing**: Utilizes satellite data to reconstruct ocean temperature and salinity profiles, eliminating the need for costly in-situ measurements.
